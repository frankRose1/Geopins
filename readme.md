# GeoPins

This is a fullstack application that uses graphql, react hooks, and subscriptions to provide real time updates to users. Users can sign up/sign in via google OAuth and being pinning locations on a map, where they can provide an image, title, and description. Users can comment on each other's pins. If a user creates a pin, deletes a pin, or comments on a pin, it will be reflected in the UI immediately on all clients with the use of subscriptions(web sockets).
